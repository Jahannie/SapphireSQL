# SapphireSQL
 The purpose of the language  is to automatize the process of query testing a database. The motivation of this project is to optimize the process of testing and releasing a database system for client use. Another purpose of the language is to enable a person, that doesnâ€™t have any knowledge of SQL, to test his or her database easily. 

The language will also verify the correctness of basic SQL queries.The testing process would involve the user in taking note of all the attributes in the table, making all possible query combination and listing expected values. This process will be automatized by receiving only an array with attributes and table names. The language will have a feature that will return a series of strings with all SQL query combinations.

Right now the only way to test queries is through unit testing. One disadvantage in these methods is that you have to write test cases for each of your tables. This language aims to facilitate this process and instead of writing the same lines of code repetitively, you just have to write one and apply it to all the tables. An advantage of using this tool is time efficiency of your database based projects by optimizing the testing phase and reducing human error. The programming language should be fast, readable and easily writeable. The syntax of the language will be similar to python and it will be built on Java.
